# Moonstone Theme for Obsidian

This is a theme I created to give me a mix of AnnuPpuccin, Border, and Minimal. I also added some features I like from ITS Theme.

> **Note:** This theme does not and will not support the Obsidian Style Settings plugin until it is updated regularly again. As of August 24, 2025, it hasn't been updated in a year so I have no plans to support it.

## Features

Since I am not supporting the Obsidian Style Settings plugin, I have tried to keep things like the accent color, fonts, etc. based upon your Obsidian settings in Settings > Appearance rather than attempting to override them.
